# Email verifier  
This is my first Project. In this project, an email input from the user is validated to ensure that it is in a valid format.

If a valid email format is entered, the output will be `You have entered a valid email address`

if the user inputs an invalid email format the output display an error.

### Note:
1. There is no need for any backend for this project, it runs locally in a browser on the client.

2. The output of this project only checks for valid email formats. It does not guarantee that the email will exit.
